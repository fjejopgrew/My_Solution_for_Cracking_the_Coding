Chapter 8. Recursion and Dynamic Programming
====

1. Triple Step
-----
A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 step, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

2. Robot in a Grid
---
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows anc c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

3. Magic Index
---
A magic index in an array A[0...n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.

4. Power Set
----
Write a meghod to return all subsets of a set.

5. Recursive Multiply
---
Write a recursive function to multiply two numbers without using the * operator. You can use addition, substraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.

6. Towers of Hanoi
-----
In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom. you have the following constraints:
(1)Only one disk can be move at a time
(2)A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower
(3)A disk can only be placed on top of a large disk

7. Permutation without Dups
---
Write a method to compute all permutations of a string of unique characters.
