Chapter 10. Sorting and Searching
====
1. Sorted Merge
----
You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

2. Group Anagram
----
Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.

3. Search in Rotated Array
----
Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.

4. Sorted Search, No Size
----
You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.

5. Sparse Search
----
Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed with empty strings, write a method to find the location of a given string.

9. Sorted Matrix Search
----
Given an M*N matrix in which each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, write a method to find an element.

10. Rank from Stream
----
Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x. Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method track, which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber, which returns the number of values less than or equal to x.
