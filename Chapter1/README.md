Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
====================
1.Is Unique
-------
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

2. Check Permutation
-----
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

3. URLify
-----
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with %20.

4. Paindrome Permutation
----
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.

5. One Away
----
There are three types of edits that can be performed on string: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Giver two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit away.

6. String Compression
---
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. If the "compressed" would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.

7. Rotate Matrix
---
Given an image represented by an N*N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

8. Zero Matrix
----
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an N*N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

9. String Rotation
--
Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring.
