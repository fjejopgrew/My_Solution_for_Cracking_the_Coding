Chapter 5. Bit Manipulation
=====
1. Insertion
----
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can asume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.

2. Binary to String
----
Given a real numbers between 0 and 1 that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".

3. Flip Bit to Win
----
You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.

4. Next Number
---
Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.

5. Debugger
----

6. Conversion
----
Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

7. Pairwise Swap
---
write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible.

8. Draw Line
---
A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be sorted in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8. The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
